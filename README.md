# Task-Manager
This project is a task manager web application where users can add, edit, and delete tasks. Tasks are displayed in a table with their names, progress bars, and progress percentages. The application utilizes local storage to persist tasks between sessions and dynamically updates the UI based on user interactions. Additionally, it features an overlay for adding and editing tasks, with the ability to toggle between "Add Task" and "Edit Task" modes.
